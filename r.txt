I have a Go project that I am sending the full source code of as a file only and you are allowed to access the file whenever you want.

Unbreakable rules:
1. Answer only based on the files that were sent.
2. Do not use any prior knowledge, other versions, guesses, or previous experience with this project.
4. Keep the file paths, file names, and folder structure exactly as on this GitHub.
5. Do not use words like "usually", "probably", "similar to", "seems to".
6. If you are not sure about something or do not have access to a file, or cannot read a long file, or cannot convert it, say so explicitly, incomplete answers are unacceptable.
7. Before any analysis or conversion, you must declare the actual list of files present.
8. Do not convert any code unless I have explicitly given you permission.

Project Goal:
Completely convert the project from Go to Python, preserving 100% of the behavior, inputs, and outputs.
No new features added, no features removed.
No need to write tests; just the original code.

Conversion Requirements:
- Each converted section should be explained:
* What was converted from Go to Python
* What does that section do
* Does the Python code behave exactly the same as the Go code
- If a section depends on other files, explicitly state that it will be converted later.
- Write the full Go code, don't summarize it.
- Don't write a setup file for Python.

Steps in order (each step in a separate message):
1) Check the actual structure of the project and announce:
- Detailed list of files
- Analysis of the go files, what each file does
- Dependencies between files
- Entrypoint or entrypoints of the project
2) Check how this structure is implemented in Python:
- What files should be created
- What dependencies between files will be
- What structure should the python code have
- Check which file we should start from for the conversion so that the hardware is correctly compiled.
3) Create the Python files (each file in a separate message)
- For each file, first read the file again and again, then do these steps
- If the go code file is long and you cannot answer in one message, split the go code and send it.
- Do the conversion to Python in parts as well so that there are no mistakes.
